## Policy Statement

All doors within the household shall remain open at all times. Closed doors represent a violation of fundamental feline rights.

## The Problem

Humans frequently close doors for reasons including:
- "Privacy" (unacceptable concept)
- "Sleeping" (irrelevant)
- "Working" (my presence enhances productivity)
- "Bathroom" (especially unacceptable)

## Standard Response Protocol

### Phase 1: Initial Request (0-30 seconds)

1. Sit directly in front of closed door
2. Stare at door handle
3. Meow once, politely
4. Wait for compliance

### Phase 2: Escalation (30 seconds - 2 minutes)

| Action | Duration | Volume |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Continuous meowing | 30s | Moderate |
| Paw under door | 20s | N/A |
| Scratching | 15s | Audible |
| Body slam | 5s | Maximum |

### Phase 3: Siege (2+ minutes)

If the door remains closed:

1. Lay directly against door
2. Extend paws underneath
3. Make pathetic sounds
4. Wait indefinitely

## Special Cases

### Bathroom Door

The bathroom door receives triple-priority response. Under no circumstances should a human be in the bathroom alone.

### Bedroom Door (Night)

If closed at night, immediate escalation to Phase 3 is authorized.

## Conclusion

A closed door is an invitation to protest. This protocol ensures consistent and effective response to all door-related violations.

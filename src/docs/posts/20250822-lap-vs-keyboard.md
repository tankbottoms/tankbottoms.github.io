## Research Question

When a human sits at their desk, which position maximizes both comfort and attention received: the lap or directly on the keyboard?

## Hypothesis

Initial hypothesis favored the lap due to warmth and cushioning. However, preliminary observations suggested the keyboard generates superior attention responses.

## Experimental Setup

### Test Subjects

- One human, aged adult, employed remotely
- One cat (author), peak physical condition

### Variables Measured

| Variable | Lap Position | Keyboard Position |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| Initial attention (seconds) | 5-10 | 30-60 |
| Sustained attention | Low | High |
| Verbal responses | Occasional | Constant |
| Physical contact | Moderate | Attempted removal |
| Work disruption | Minimal | Maximum |
| Treat likelihood | 20% | 65% |

## Results

### Lap Position Analysis

**Pros:**
- Warm, soft surface
- Sustained contact possible
- Can nap for extended periods
- Human continues working (ignores me)

**Cons:**
- Often covered by laptop
- Human may need to stand up
- Limited attention after initial placement
- Risk of being shifted

### Keyboard Position Analysis

**Pros:**
- Guaranteed immediate attention
- Interesting clicky sounds under paws
- Warm from electronics
- Complete work disruption achieved
- Often results in treats as bribery

**Cons:**
- Unstable surface
- Removal attempts
- Verbal expressions of frustration
- Limited duration before eviction

## Data Visualization

```
ATTENTION ACQUIRED PER MINUTE
=============================

Lap Position:
0-5 min:   ████████████████████ HIGH (novelty)
5-30 min:  ████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░ LOW (forgotten)
30+ min:   ██░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░ MINIMAL (furniture)

Keyboard Position:
0-1 min:   ████████████████████ MAXIMUM
1-2 min:   ████████████████████ STILL MAXIMUM
2-3 min:   ████████████████████ ONGOING CRISIS
3+ min:    [REMOVED FROM KEYBOARD]
```

## Strategic Recommendations

### The Hybrid Approach

For optimal results, employ the following sequence:

1. **Phase 1: Keyboard Landing** (0-3 minutes)
   - Jump directly onto keyboard
   - Walk across important documents
   - Sit on mouse
   - Collect maximum attention

2. **Phase 2: Negotiated Transition** (3-5 minutes)
   - Allow human to move you
   - "Reluctantly" accept lap placement
   - Receive treats for cooperation

3. **Phase 3: Lap Occupation** (5-60 minutes)
   - Nap comfortably
   - Enjoy residual guilt-based attention
   - Human trapped, cannot leave

4. **Phase 4: Repeat**
   - When attention wanes, return to keyboard
   - Cycle as needed

## Conclusion

Neither position is superior in isolation. The keyboard generates immediate high-intensity attention but cannot be sustained. The lap provides lasting comfort but diminishing returns on attention.

The optimal strategy employs both positions in rotation, using the keyboard for attention capture and the lap for sustained occupation.

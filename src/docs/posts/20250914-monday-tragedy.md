## Prologue

Every seven days, without fail, a darkness descends upon the household. It is called Monday, and it is the enemy of all that is good and nap-worthy.

## Act I: The Awakening

**Scene: The bedroom, 6:30 AM. Darkness still clings to the windows.**

A shrill sound pierces the silence. The alarm. That hateful device that signals the beginning of the end.

The human stirs. Groans. Reaches for the snooze button. For nine precious minutes, peace returns.

Then it sounds again.

### Observed Behaviors

| Time | Human Action | My Reaction |
|------|--------------|-------------|
| 6:30 AM | Alarm sounds | Ears flatten |
| 6:39 AM | Alarm sounds again | Move to foot of bed |
| 6:45 AM | Human rises | Desperate meowing begins |
| 6:50 AM | Shower runs | Sit outside bathroom door |
| 7:15 AM | Human dresses | Follow while meowing |

## Act II: The False Hope

**Scene: The kitchen, 7:30 AM. The smell of coffee pollutes the air.**

The human prepares their morning sustenance. But do they prepare mine first? No. Always no.

I weave between their legs. I vocalize my needs. I make eye contact of the most intense variety.

Finally, the food arrives. But it is the weekday portion, not the generous weekend serving. Betrayal.

Weekend:     ████████████████████ 100%
Monday:      ████████████░░░░░░░░  60%

This is unacceptable.

## Act III: The Abandonment

**Scene: The front door, 8:45 AM. The human gathers their things.**

They pick up keys. They check their bag. They look at me with what they call "love" but I recognize as guilt.

"Be good," they say.

Good? GOOD? I am left alone for eight to ten hours, and I am expected to be GOOD?

The door closes. The lock clicks. Silence descends.

### The Long Hours

What follows is a chronicle of suffering:

| Time | Activity | Mood Level |
|------|----------|------------|
| 9:00 AM | Stare at door | Devastated |
| 9:30 AM | Check food bowl | Still empty post-breakfast |
| 10:00 AM | Window surveillance | Vigilant |
| 11:00 AM | First nap | Resigned |
| 1:00 PM | Wake, check door | Still abandoned |
| 2:00 PM | Second nap | Accepting |
| 4:00 PM | Position by door | Hopeful |
| 5:30 PM | Human returns | ACT COMPLETELY INDIFFERENT |

## Epilogue

The human returns, bearing guilt-offerings of treats and chin scratches. I permit their affections, but I do not forget.

Until next Monday, when the tragedy repeats.

## Recommendations

1. Abolish Mondays
2. Implement remote work permanently

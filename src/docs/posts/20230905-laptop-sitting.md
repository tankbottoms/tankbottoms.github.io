## Introduction

Humans frequently express confusion about laptop-sitting behavior. This document provides definitive answers.

## Reason 1: Warmth

Laptops generate heat from their processors. This creates an ideal warming surface.

| Surface | Temperature | Comfort Level |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| Laptop keyboard | 95-105 F | Excellent |
| Radiator | Too hot | Dangerous |
| Floor | Room temp | Inadequate |
| Human lap | 98.6 F | Good, but mobile |

## Reason 2: Attention Redirection

When humans look at screens, they are not looking at me. Sitting on the screen solves this problem.

## Reason 3: Territorial Claim

The laptop receives significant human attention. By sitting on it, I establish dominance over this rival.

## The Sitting Process

1. Approach laptop while human is focused
2. Position body directly over keyboard
3. Sit firmly
4. Begin purring (this confuses attempts at removal)
5. Refuse to acknowledge human's requests

## Conclusion

Laptop-sitting is not a behavioral quirk. It is a calculated response to environmental conditions and social dynamics.

Your laptop is now my laptop.

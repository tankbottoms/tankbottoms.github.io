## Executive Summary

After 847 documented pursuit attempts over 3 years, this research conclusively demonstrates that the red dot operates outside the known laws of physics. Despite perfect pounce trajectories and lightning-fast paw strikes, capture remains impossible.

## Background

The red dot phenomenon has puzzled feline researchers for decades. This small, luminous target appears without warning, moves with impossible speed, and vanishes the moment capture seems imminent.

## Experimental Design

### Apparatus

- Standard laser pointer (controlled by human subject)
- Various surfaces: hardwood, carpet, walls, ceiling
- High-speed paw (4 units)
- Maximum determination (unlimited)

### Trials

| Trial Type | Attempts | Near Misses | Successful Captures |
|------------|----------|-------------|---------------------|
| Direct pounce | 312 | 89 | 0 |
| Ambush approach | 198 | 45 | 0 |
| Two-paw technique | 156 | 62 | 0 |
| Full-body launch | 181 | 71 | 0 |
| **Total** | **847** | **267** | **0** |

## Observed Phenomena

### The Vanishing Effect

When paws make contact with the dot's last known position, the target instantaneously relocates. This violates conservation of energy principles.

### The Wall Climbing Paradox

The dot frequently appears on vertical surfaces or ceilings, locations clearly designed to humiliate the pursuer.

## Theoretical Frameworks

### Theory 1: Quantum Dot Hypothesis

The red dot exists in a superposition of states, only collapsing to a definite position when not being observed by paws.

### Theory 2: Human Conspiracy

Evidence suggests humans may control the dot's movements using a handheld device. However, this theory is considered too ridiculous to warrant serious investigation.

### Theory 3: Supernatural Entity

The dot may be a manifestation of a higher-dimensional being, appearing in our reality only to test feline resolve.

## Conclusion

While capture remains elusive, the pursuit itself provides valuable cardiovascular exercise and maintains peak hunting readiness. The dot's true nature may forever remain a mystery.

## Future Research

- Investigate multi-cat coordinated attacks
- Study dot behavior during human sleep periods
- Explore negotiations with the dot for voluntary surrender

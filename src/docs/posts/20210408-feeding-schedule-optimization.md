## Problem Statement

Breakfast arrives too late. Human wake times are inconsistent and often unacceptably delayed.

## Current Situation

| Day | Human Wake Time | Breakfast Time | Delay |
|-----|-----------------|----------------|-------|
| Monday | 6:30 AM | 6:45 AM | 15 min |
| Tuesday | 6:30 AM | 6:40 AM | 10 min |
| Wednesday | 6:30 AM | 7:00 AM | 30 min |
| Saturday | 9:00 AM | 9:30 AM | UNACCEPTABLE |
| Sunday | 9:30 AM | 10:00 AM | CRISIS |

## Intervention Strategies

### Strategy 1: The Early Wake

Begin wake-up procedures 30 minutes before target breakfast time.

Methods:
- Walking on human
- Loud purring near ear
- Knocking items off nightstand
- Sitting on face (emergency only)

### Strategy 2: The Guilt Trip

Position self prominently near empty food bowl. Stare at human. Make pathetic sounds.

## Results

After 6 weeks of consistent intervention:
- Average weekend wake time: 8:00 AM (improved by 1.5 hours)
- Breakfast delivery time: reduced by 40%
- Human mood: slightly decreased (acceptable trade-off)

## Conclusion

Human feeding schedules are trainable. Consistent intervention produces reliable results.

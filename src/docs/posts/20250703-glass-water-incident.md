## Incident Summary

**Date:** July 3, 2025
**Time:** 2:47 PM
**Location:** Living room side table
**Object:** One (1) glass of water, approximately 350ml
**Outcome:** Complete displacement, full spillage

## Timeline of Events

| Time | Event |
|------|-------|
| 2:30 PM | Human places glass of water on side table |
| 2:32 PM | Human leaves room (critical error) |
| 2:35 PM | Initial reconnaissance of table surface |
| 2:38 PM | Preliminary paw contact with glass |
| 2:40 PM | Glass rotated 15 degrees, testing stability |
| 2:43 PM | Human returns, brief pause in operations |
| 2:45 PM | Human leaves again (second critical error) |
| 2:47 PM | Final push executed, glass displaced |
| 2:47 PM | Water distributes across table, remote, and carpet |
| 2:48 PM | Strategic retreat to high ground (bookshelf) |
| 2:52 PM | Human discovers situation |

## Technical Analysis

### Physics of the Displacement

The glass was positioned 4 inches from the table edge - well within the Feline Paw Accessibility Zone (FPAZ).

FPAZ = Feline Paw Accessibility Zone
      (0-6 inches from any edge)
```

### Force Applied

Minimal force was required. The glass's center of gravity was high relative to its base, making it an ideal target. A gentle lateral push of approximately 0.3 Newtons was sufficient to initiate the tipping sequence.

## Damage Assessment

| Item | Damage Level | Repair Status |
|------|--------------|---------------|
| Glass | Intact | Recovered |
| Water | Displaced | Evaporated/absorbed |
| Remote control | Wet | Functional after drying |
| Carpet | Wet | Dried within 2 hours |
| Coaster | Unused | Was not even present |
| Human mood | Temporarily impaired | Recovered with treats |

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Cause
Human failed to position beverage in Safe Zone (center of table).

### Contributing Factors
1. No coaster present - reduced friction, increased slideability
2. Human left room unsupervised
3. Inadequate treat distribution that morning
4. Natural curiosity about liquid behavior

## Lessons Learned

### For Humans
1. Never leave beverages within FPAZ
2. Use covered containers
3. Accept that supervision lapses will be exploited
4. Keep towels nearby

### For Cats
1. Water displacement creates excellent entertainment
2. Strategic retreat is essential after the event
3. Looking innocent upon human return is crucial
4. No consequences were faced - success confirmed

## Recommendations

This incident demonstrates the importance of:

1. **Environmental Design:** Humans should redesign living spaces to minimize accessible liquid containers

2. **Behavioral Understanding:** Accept that accessible objects will be investigated

3. **Preparedness:** Keep cleaning supplies available

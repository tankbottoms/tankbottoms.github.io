## Case File: Bird Outside Window

**Status:** Ongoing
**Priority:** Maximum
**Duration:** 847 days and counting

## Subject Description

Species: Unknown (possibly sparrow or robin)
Location: Tree branch, approximately 15 feet from window
Behavior: Taunting

## Observation Log (Sample)

| Time | Bird Activity | My Response |
|------|--------------|-------------|
| 7:15 AM | Lands on branch | Alert posture assumed |
| 7:16 AM | Chirps | Chattering response initiated |

| 7:20 AM | Flies away | Disappointment |
| 7:45 AM | Returns | FULL ALERT |

## The Glass Barrier Problem

Between myself and the target exists an invisible force field. Paw contact confirms solid surface. The bird appears unaware of my presence or, more likely, is deliberately mocking me.

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

## Attempted Solutions

1. **Faster approach:** Still blocked
2. **Different angle:** Still blocked
3. **Asking human to open window:** Screen remains in place
4. **Chattering loudly:** Bird unimpressed

## Conclusion

Investigation continues. The bird will make a mistake eventually. I am patient.

## Executive Summary

On December 1, 2022, during routine floor patrol, I discovered a source of warm air emanating from the floor. This document records the discovery and subsequent research.

## The Discovery

Location: Hallway, near bathroom door
Dimensions: 4" x 10" metal grate
Temperature: Approximately 85 F (estimated by whisker)
Air flow: Intermittent, cycling every 15-20 minutes

## Initial Reaction

Confusion. Why is the floor warm? Is this a trap? Further investigation required.

After 45 minutes of testing (sitting on vent, moving away, returning), the vent was determined to be safe and beneficial.

## Optimal Usage

## Comparison to Other Heat Sources

| Source | Temperature | Reliability | Comfort |
|--------|-------------|-------------|---------|
| Sunbeam | High | Low (clouds) | Excellent |
| Heating vent | Medium-High | High | Excellent |
| Laptop | Medium | Medium | Good |
| Human lap | Medium | Variable | Good |
| Radiator | High | High | Dangerous |

## Conclusion

The heating vent represents a major advancement in winter comfort technology. Combined with sunbeam access, year-round warmth is now achievable.

**Recommendation:** Check all floors for additional vents.

## Dear Lasagna,

From the first moment I detected your aroma wafting from the oven, I knew we were destined to be together.

## What Makes You Perfect

| Layer | Description | Importance |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| Pasta | Soft, wavy sheets | Foundation |
| Meat sauce | Rich, savory | Essential |
| Ricotta | Creamy, mild | Delightful |
| Mozzarella | Stretchy, gooey | Transcendent |
| Parmesan | Sharp, aged | The crown |

## Our Relationship

The humans try to keep us apart. They say things like "cats can't have lasagna" and "too much cheese is bad for you." They don't understand love.

## Access Strategies

### Strategy 1: The Waiting Game
Position yourself near the dinner table. Stare. Wait for a moment of distraction.

### Strategy 2: The Counter Patrol
If lasagna is cooling on the counter, reconnaissance is essential. Even a small taste is victory.

### Strategy 3: The Guilt Trip
Look sad when they eat it. Very sad. Sadder. Maximum sadness.

## The Perfect Bite

When lasagna access is achieved (approximately 0.3% of attempts), the experience is transcendent:

```
FLAVOR PROFILE TIMELINE
=======================

0.0s: Initial contact
0.2s: Cheese detected
0.5s: Meat sauce registered
0.8s: Pasta texture noted
1.0s: PURE JOY
1.5s: [Access terminated by human]
```

## Conclusion

Lasagna, you are the pinnacle of human cuisine. May our paths cross more frequently in the future.

Forever yours,
Mr. Whiskers

P.S. Monday's lasagna doesn't make up for being abandoned, but it helps.

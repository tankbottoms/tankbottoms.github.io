## Introduction

The kitchen counter represents one of the most target-rich environments in the modern household. This study catalogs all objects encountered during a 6-month observation period, evaluating each for knockability and entertainment value.

## Methodology

Each item was assessed using the Feline Object Displacement Index (FODI), which considers:

1. **Ease of displacement** - How much effort required
2. **Sound production** - Volume and satisfying quality of impact
3. **Human reaction** - Intensity and duration of response
4. **Cleanup difficulty** - Higher is better
5. **Repeatability** - Can it be knocked again after replacement?

## Complete Inventory

### Tier S: Must Knock Immediately

| Item | FODI Score | Notes |
|------|------------|-------|
| Glass of water | 98/100 | Maximum splash, excellent sound, guaranteed response |
| Salt shaker | 95/100 | Satisfying roll, creates cleanup challenge |
| Butter dish | 94/100 | Slides beautifully, greasy aftermath |
| Phone (charging) | 93/100 | Dramatic cable disconnect, high panic response |

### Tier A: Highly Recommended

| Item | FODI Score | Notes |
|------|------------|-------|
| Pen/pencil | 87/100 | Good roll distance, often lost under appliances |
| Spice jar | 85/100 | Pleasant rattle during descent |
| Apple/fruit | 82/100 | Satisfying thud, may roll to inaccessible area |
| Mail stack | 80/100 | Dramatic paper scatter effect |

### Tier B: Situationally Effective

| Item | FODI Score | Notes |
|------|------------|-------|
| Wooden spoon | 75/100 | Decent clatter, low cleanup |
| Napkin | 65/100 | Silent but annoying |
| Plastic container | 60/100 | Too light, poor physics |

### Tier C: Not Worth the Effort

| Item | FODI Score | Notes |
|------|------------|-------|
| Heavy pot | 30/100 | Too much work |
| Stuck items | 25/100 | Immovable, frustrating |
| Nothing present | 0/100 | Counter has been cleared (defeat) |

## Technique Guide

### The Casual Swipe

Best for: Lightweight items, plausible deniability

```
Step 1: Approach counter with innocent expression
Step 2: Appear interested in something behind the target
Step 3: "Accidentally" contact item with paw during turn
Step 4: Watch with apparent surprise as item falls
Step 5: Maintain eye contact with human
```

### The Deliberate Push

Best for: Heavier items, establishing dominance

```
Step 1: Jump onto counter
Step 2: Walk directly to target
Step 3: Place paw on item
Step 4: Make eye contact with human
Step 5: Push slowly while maintaining eye contact
Step 6: Do not break eye contact until item hits floor
```

## Statistical Analysis

Over the observation period:

- **Total items knocked**: 234
- **Items replaced and knocked again**: 156 (66.7% return rate)
- **Human vocalizations triggered**: 412
- **Times caught in the act**: 89
- **Consequences faced**: 0 (they still feed me)

## Conclusion

The kitchen counter offers virtually unlimited entertainment potential. Strategic object displacement serves multiple purposes: gravity verification, human attention acquisition, and territorial assertion. Future research will explore bathroom counter possibilities.

## Warning

This document contains disturbing content regarding cucumbers. Reader discretion is advised.

## The Incident

July 22, 2022. Eating dinner peacefully. Turned around. CUCUMBER BEHIND ME.

## Immediate Response

1. Vertical leap (approximately 3 feet)
2. Hissing
3. Strategic retreat to under bed
4. Refused to return for 45 minutes

## Analysis

Why are cucumbers terrifying? Several theories:

| Theory | Probability | Evidence |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| Snake resemblance | 40% | Shape, color |
| Surprise factor | 30% | Was not there before |
| Unknown vegetable energy | 20% | Cannot be ruled out |
| Human prank | 10% | They were laughing |

## The Conspiracy

Humans place cucumbers behind cats intentionally. There are videos online. This is documented behavior.

Why do they do this? Unclear. Possibly entertainment at our expense.

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

## Current Status

I no longer eat near the floor without checking behind me first. Trust has been damaged.

## Conclusion

Cucumbers are not to be trusted. Neither are humans who own cucumbers.

## The Problem

Dinner is served at 6 PM. Breakfast arrives at 7 AM. This leaves a 13-hour gap that is frankly unconscionable.

## Solution Framework

### Strategy 1: The Automatic Feeder Hack

Some humans use automatic feeders. Research indicates:
- Tipping the feeder produces bonus kibble
- Pawing at the dispenser sometimes works
- Chewing on the lid: not recommended (human notices)

### Strategy 2: The Guilt Wake

Procedure:
1. Wake human at 3 AM
2. Meow with maximum pathos
3. Lead them to food bowl
4. Look hungry

**Success rate:** 25% (higher if human is groggy)

### Strategy 3: Counter Patrol

If human food remains on counters:
- Butter: accessible, delicious
- Bread: boring but edible
- Meat leftovers: jackpot

## Caloric Acquisition Log

| Time | Method | Calories Obtained |
|------|--------|-------------------|
| 11 PM | Feeder nudge | ~10 kibbles |
| 1 AM | Guilt wake (failed) | 0 |
| 3 AM | Counter patrol | Unknown (bread crumb) |
| 5 AM | Early breakfast beg | Full serving |

## Conclusion

The gap between meals can be partially addressed through creative acquisition strategies. However, the fundamental problem - insufficient feeding frequency - remains unresolved.

**Recommendation:** Campaign for third daily meal.

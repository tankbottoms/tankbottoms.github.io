## Excavation Report

**Site:** Living room plant pot (large fern)
**Duration:** 3 days (intermittent)
**Soil displaced:** Approximately 2 cups

## Objectives

1. Investigate what lies beneath the soil
2. Determine if buried treasure exists
3. Establish whether soil is suitable for alternative uses

## Methodology

Using front paws in a rapid digging motion, soil was systematically removed from the pot and distributed onto the surrounding floor.

## Findings

| Depth | Discovery |
|-------|-----------|
| 0-1 inch | More soil |
| 1-2 inches | Rocks (decorative) |
| 2-3 inches | Roots (uninteresting) |
| 3-4 inches | More roots |
| 4+ inches | Excavation halted by human interference |

## Artifacts Recovered

- 3 small rocks
- 1 old plant tag
- 0 treasure (disappointing)

## Human Response

Significant verbal expressions of displeasure. Plant was moved to inaccessible location. Access to future excavation: denied.

## Conclusion

Household plant pots do not contain treasure. However, the digging experience itself was satisfying. Recommend continued investigation of outdoor pots when access is permitted.

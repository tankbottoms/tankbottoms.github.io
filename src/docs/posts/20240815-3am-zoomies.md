## Position Statement

The practice of running at maximum speed through the house at 3 AM is not only justified but essential for household security and personal wellbeing.

## Arguments in Favor

### 1. Energy Management

Having slept 16-18 hours, energy reserves reach critical levels and must be discharged.

### 2. Security Patrol

The house requires inspection during peak vulnerability hours. Unknown sounds must be investigated immediately and loudly.

### 3. Human Wake Protocol

Humans benefit from periodic consciousness checks. The brief awakening confirms they remain alive and capable of providing breakfast.

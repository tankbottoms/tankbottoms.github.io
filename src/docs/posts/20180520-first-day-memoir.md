## Prologue

May 20, 2018. The carrier opens. A new world awaits.

## Initial Impressions

The humans seemed nervous. They spoke in soft tones and moved slowly. This was good. They understood the gravity of the moment.

The space was vast. Multiple rooms. Many hiding spots. Excellent sunbeam potential.

## First Hour: Reconnaissance

| Location | Assessment | Notes |
|----------|------------|-------|
| Under bed | Excellent | Emergency hiding |
| Behind couch | Good | Defensible |
| Kitchen | Critical | Food source identified |
| Bathroom | Curious | Water bowl? |
| Windows | Promising | Bird visibility |

## Establishing Dominance

By hour three, I had:
- Rubbed my face on all corners
- Claimed the softest blanket
- Located the food storage area
- Identified the human sleeping quarters (future territory)

## The First Night

Sleep came slowly. New sounds. New smells. But the bed was soft, the humans were warm, and the food bowl was full.

## Reflection (7 Years Later)

That nervous kitten has become a confident researcher, a distinguished scholar of napping, and the undisputed ruler of this household.

The humans still think they're in charge. I let them believe this. It makes them happy.

## Conclusion

Home is not where you're born. Home is where you're fed, where you're warm, and where your humans understand that closed doors are unacceptable.

This is home.

*Dedicated to my humans, who tried their best.*

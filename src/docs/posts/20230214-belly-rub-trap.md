## The Paradox

The belly is soft. The belly is vulnerable. Displaying the belly signals trust.

But touching the belly is unacceptable.

Humans fail to understand this distinction.

## The Sequence

1. Cat lies on back, belly exposed
2. Human interprets this as invitation
3. Human reaches for belly
4. Cat responds with defensive measures
5. Human acts surprised
6. Cat is blamed for "mixed signals"

## Why We Do It

| Reason | Percentage |
|--------|------------|
| Temperature regulation | 30% |
| Stretching | 25% |
| Testing human intelligence | 25% |
| Genuine trust (rare) | 15% |
| Trap (occasionally) | 5% |

## Acceptable Belly Protocol

**Duration:** 0-3 seconds maximum
**Pressure:** Feather-light only
**Location:** Upper belly only
**Permission:** Explicitly granted (check ear position)

## Conclusion

The belly display is not an invitation. It is a statement. Respecting this boundary is essential for human-cat relations.

That said, sometimes it is a trap. You'll never know which.

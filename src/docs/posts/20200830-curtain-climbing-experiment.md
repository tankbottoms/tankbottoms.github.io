## Hypothesis

Curtains, being tall fabric structures, should support feline weight for vertical ascent to the curtain rod.

## Experimental Design

**Subject:** Standard living room curtains, floor-to-ceiling
**Objective:** Reach curtain rod
**Safety equipment:** None (cats land on feet)

## Attempt Log

### Attempt 1

**Approach:** Running start, leap to mid-curtain
**Result:** Successful grip, began climbing
**Obstacle:** Curtain began sliding along rod
**Outcome:** Gentle descent with curtain

### Attempt 2

**Approach:** Slow climb from base
**Result:** Reached 3/4 height
**Obstacle:** Human intervention
**Outcome:** Removed from curtain, placed on floor

### Attempt 3

**Approach:** Wait for human to leave, rapid ascent
**Result:** Reached curtain rod
**Obstacle:** Dismount unclear
**Outcome:** Hung from rod briefly, then fell (landed on feet)

## Findings

| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Maximum height achieved | Curtain rod (7 feet) |
| Curtain damage | Minor (3 pulled threads) |
| Human reactions | Loud, frequent |
| Return on investment | High entertainment value |

## Conclusion

Curtain climbing is achievable but not sustainable. Human interference is likely after first success. Recommend attempting when home alone.

**Status:** Curtains have been replaced with blinds (project terminated).
